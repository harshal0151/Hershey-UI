          <h1>The Man Behind Good Business and Good Chocolate</h1>
          <p>
            In addition to leaving us with America’s most iconic chocolate bar,
            Milton S. Hershey left behind a legacy of goodness. It’s a story of
            persistence, spirit, compassion, selflessness and purpose.

              <h2>Milton Hershey: A Legacy of Goodness that Lives On</h2>
              <p>
                One built on compassion. Selflessness. Purpose. Our founder
                established a school that prepares boys and girls for success in
                all aspects of life; along with community buildings, civic
                centers, gardens and cultural institutions that continue to grow
                today.
              </p>
              <p>
                His spirit has never faltered, nor has it ever failed to inspire
                us. It’s this very legacy that led The Hershey Company 125 years
                ago, and it’s a legacy that’ll us lead for years to come. When
                we invest in businesses that make a difference, reduce our
                environmental footprint, enhance the livelihood of communities,
                or provide a brighter future for children across the world, we
                do so in the spirit of Milton — a man who taught us business is
                a matter of service. That generosity leads to the richest of
                rewards. And that one’s happiness is dependent on the joy of
                others.

              <h2>A Story as Iconic as the Chocolate Bar</h2>
              <p>
                Milton Hershey made his mark as a successful confectioner,
                philanthropist and innovator. But Milton was by no means an
                overnight success story, nor did his achievements come without
                their hardships.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, his first two candy companies were met with failure. It
                wasn’t until his third business that Milton’s hard work and
                talent paid off. From then on, Milton prospered as a successful
                businessman and generous humanitarian that improved the lives of
                thousands.

                <p>
                  On October 13th, Milton died at 88 years of age. The legacy of
                  this chocolatier, philanthropist, innovator and social
                  entrepreneur lives on to this day.

            <h2>The School</h2>
            <p>
              Perhaps Milton’s most cherished contribution to the community was
              the Hershey Industrial School for orphaned boys. Founded by Milton
              and his wife Catherine, they built the school with the intention
              of providing young boys with a productive and fulfilling life.
              Having had no children of their own, they came to consider the
              boys as family. Now named the Milton Hershey School, this
              institution fosters the academic and social potential of over
              2,000 boys and girls a year, providing them with the skills and
              resources for success in all areas of life. Prior to his death,
              Milton left the entirety of his fortune with the school to ensure
              its continued success.

            <h2>The Great Building Campaign</h2>
            <p>
              Milton took great pride in his community. And when the Great
              Depression threatened it with economic disaster, Milton responded
              with a major construction program known as The Great Building
              Campaign. This project saw the employment of over 600 workers to
              build a number of major structures, which continue to thrive
              today. This includes the Hotel Hershey, Hershey Community Theatre,
              the Community Building, the Hershey Sports Arena and many other
              institutions.

            <h2>The Community</h2>
            <p>
                Milton Hershey believed that employees who were treated fairly and lived in comfortable living environments would be better workers. It was this very idea that sparked a lifelong passion for Milton: building a model community where its people would be proud to live and work — and above all, where they would succeed. Milton proceeded to build a community complete with housing, a bank, a hotel, public schools, churches, parks, a zoo, and even a trolley system — all to enhance the quality of life for the employees he considered family. By treating them with dignity and prosperity, Milton inspired loyalty and admiration from all his workers.

            <p>
              Milton Hershey was a man of many titles, and social entrepreneur
              was one of them. It was Milton’s wit, instinct and knack for
              innovation and drive to enhance the quality of life for others
              that led to some of The Hershey Company’s most revolutionary
              measures.
